README FILE
------------

(!!Current version is tested only on Win32 systems!!)


 Basic Requirements
 -----------------------------------------------------

 1. Win32 System -  The Frontend client requires .NET Framework 3.5 installed to run. 
                    (This should be available anyway with Windows XP SP3!)
 2. Strawberry Perl installed
 3. Have OpenSSL installed for IMAPS connections (check Build & Install section)
 4. Required Perl modules must be installed (check Build & Install section) 
 
 
 Build & INSTALL
 -----------------------------------------------------
 Follow these steps in order to build and run the project.

 1. Have Strawberry Perl installed. (http://strawberryperl.com/) 
 
 2. Have OpenSSL installed. (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm)
 
 3. Go to scripts/ folder and start install-required-perl-modules.bat script in order to install required Perl modules.
 
 4. Go to frontend/ folder and use the Visual Studio 2008 solution to start and build the project.
 
 5. Open a command line console and go to project build/ folder. 
 
 6. Set the environment variable PROJECT_PATH i.e. SET PROJECT_PATH=c:\emex\project
 
 7. Start the build script - build.bat
 
 8. Go to build/dist/ folder and locate the emex zip archive, which contains the distributable project contents.
 
 9. Extract the emex zip archive in some filder i.e. c:\emex-full.
 
 10 Start the project using the emex.bat script !
 
 11. Use credentials "emex/emex" (without quotes) for the Backend username and password paremters. 

 TroubleShooting
 -----------------------------------------------------
 (Log files are placed in x:\emex-install-path\data\logs folder)
 
 1. PROBLEM: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it 127.0.0.1:8080
    CAUSES:

    o Check if you have webservice (i.e. Apache) running on localhost and port 8080

    o Check if all Perl modules are installed - open a console and go to the EmEx install folder, Type:
      "perl backend/bootstrap.pl"
      If there are no errors, then Perl is OK!

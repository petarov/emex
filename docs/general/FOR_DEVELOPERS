 FOR DEVELOPERS
 --------------

 1. Perl Modules
 It is required that the following modules are installed on your Perl installation.
 (Check scripts/install-required-perl-modules.bat)

 
 2. Frontend Client
 The Frontend client is a .NET 3.5 application. This means you should have Visual Studio 2008 installed. Sorry! :-P

 3. Testing tools
 I used the following:
 
 o  Hamster.2.1.0.11 (http://www.arcorhome.de/newshamster/tgl/misc/hamster_en.html) - IMAP, POP3, SMTP
 o  Mozilla Thunderbird (http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/) - EMail client
 o  The Bat (http://www.ritlabs.com/) - (Did they go commercial ?!) - EMail client

 
 Known Issues
 -----------------------------------------------------

 1. By 03.Jun.2009 - There was still an issue to install SOAP::Lite
 within CPAN (Ref: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=37151).
 Resolution to copy modules manually was used !
 (THIS IS OBSOLETE, SINCE I DECIDED TO GO THE JSON WAY)

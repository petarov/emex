 FOR DEVELOPERS
 --------------

 1. Perl Modules
 
 o It is required that the following modules are installed on your Perl installation.
   (Check scripts/install-required-perl-modules.bat)
 
 o Some words on IO:Socket:SSL Perl module. This module requires a valid OpenSSL on the machine. The OpenSSL
   binaries must be accessible on the command line (modify the %PATH% environment variable).
 
 2. Frontend Client
 The Frontend client is a .NET 3.5 application. This means you should have Visual Studio 2008 installed. Sorry! :-P
 
 3. Compiling
 Follow these steps in order to build and run the project.

     o Have Strawberry Perl installed. (http://strawberryperl.com/) 
     o Have OpenSSL installed. (http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
     o Go to scripts/ folder and start install-required-perl-modules.bat script in order to install required Perl modules.
     o Go to frontend/ folder and use the Visual Studio 2008 solution to start and build the project.
     o Open a command line console and go to project build/ folder. 
     o Set the environment variable PROJECT_PATH i.e. SET PROJECT_PATH=c:\emex\project
     o Start the build script - build.bat
     o Go to build/dist/ folder and locate the emex zip archive, which contains the distributable project contents.
     o Extract the emex zip archive in some folder i.e. c:\emex.
     o Start the project using the emex.bat script !
     o Use (default) credentials "emex/emex" (without quotes) for the Backend username and password paremters. 

 4. Testing tools
 
 I used the following:
 
 o  Hamster.2.1.0.11 (http://www.arcorhome.de/newshamster/tgl/misc/hamster_en.html) - IMAP, POP3, SMTP
 o  Mozilla Thunderbird (http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/) - EMail client
 o  The Bat (http://www.ritlabs.com/) - (Did they go commercial ?!) - EMail client

 
 Known Issues
 -----------------------------------------------------

 1. By 03.Jun.2009 - There was still an issue to install SOAP::Lite
 within CPAN (Ref: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=37151).
 Resolution to copy modules manually was used !
 (THIS IS OBSOLETE, SINCE I DECIDED TO GO THE JSON WAY)
